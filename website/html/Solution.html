        <h2 tabindex="1">Development and implementation of the solution</h2>
        <p tabindex="1">
            We decided to start ideating around a platform described on the problem page. Our focus has been on making the platform simple to navigate and enjoyable to use. The enjoyment becomes implemented via two factors. First the ones allready invested in working towards a better, more sustainable future will have a platform for locating and creating events that supports their cause. We hope that such an app would make it easier for people to come together and make these changes more easily. Second we also decided that some form of gamification would create incentives for people to stay active on our platform.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="1">
            Our solution for said problem is to make a website/app based platform. This platform uses GPS data to track nearby events other people have created and will track self made events as well. There will be options to categorise events based on location or field of impact. This way you can choose to go to events that directly affects the things you care about the most. Another function we plan to implement is a map function that lets you see events close to you or to your selected region. 
        </p>
        
        
         <p tabindex="1">
            Odeta developed the prototype with developing tool Adobe XD to visualise the idea better. This prototype represents the platform where people can get notified about different events that the user showed interest in. It is possible to create an event, join one or invite friends to participate together.
        </p>
        
        <p tabindex="1">
             First prototype was created to represent the basic user flow. Elements such as create an event, see events,see the map was created. User testing was done to get feedback. Users were happy with overall idea. Users often pointed out empty background and some inconsistency in user flow. Some frames lacked button back. Back button was hard to see on the map. Based on the feedback that was received certain changes has been made. Background was added to represent a tree sprout that will grow with user involving into different events. Back button was made  more visible and in all necessary frames. 
        </p>
        
        <p tabindex="1">
            In the future divided users could be created, to give access to create events only to organisations, to prevent user from abusing the platform. More detailed overview of the users activities should be added as well as more variety of themes that represents the progress. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p tabindex="1">You can try the app prototype<a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/e637d69f-2822-43b0-504f-540848705699-9006/?fullscreen&hints=off" alt="Link to a app prototype" tabindex="1"> here</a> </p>
        
        <h2 tabindex="1">Explaining the gamification aspect</h2>
        
        <p tabindex="1">
            We came up with the idea of maybe having a dynamic background that evolved based on event participation. This seemed like a great idea so we started sketching some evolutions. The users of our platform will be able to decide between three background presets. One for aquatic life, one for life on land and one for floral life. When the user has chosen a preset, they will have this as their background on the app. It starts small. In the aquatic version you see a lonely fish swimming around. In the life on land version, you might see a random animal by itself. And In the floral one you might see a treeseed barely sprouting. 
        <p tabindex="1">
            As you progress and participate in events, so does your theme. The fish will start to get accompanied by other species and the screen will become more alive. The lonely animal will get friends as well, and soon the screen will flourish with a diversity of life. The seed starts to grow, to branch out. And before you know it, a lush forest stand before you. 
        </p>
        <p tabindex="1">
            This will work as an incentive to participate in events near you. And the feedback, besides for doing something good for the environment of course, will be shown as a visual change in your app. You help the world, and at the same time grow your own little ecosystem. 
        </p>

        <h2 tabindex="1"> How does the solution connect to the problem?</h2>
        
        <h3 tabindex="1">Connection by the 17 goals set by the UN: </h3>
        <p tabindex="1">
            Since we started by mentioning the UN goals its only proper to continue by showing how we relate those goals to our solution.
            <br>
            How our solution fits into the UN goals:
            
        </p>
        
        <li tabindex="1">4. Quality Education:</li>
        <p class="unGoal" tabindex="1">
            Makes it possible to share information about climate change and the effect certain things has on it. As well as providing training in actions one could take to battle climate change.
        </p>
        
        <li tabindex="1">11. Sustainable cities and communities:</li>
        <p class="unGoal" tabindex="1">
            Helps engage the population in participating in local environmental events. People get more aware. In return communities and cities will hopefully take more steps to ensure a more sustainable community model.
        </p>
        
        <li tabindex="1">13. Climate action:</li>
        <p class="unGoal" tabindex="1">
            An app/Website of this type will hopefully make more people take action and give them awareness of where and when to take said action. Our idea could spread the word of environmental issues and make more people involved.
        </p>
        
        <li tabindex="1">14. Life below water:</li>
        <p class="unGoal" tabindex="1">
            People could organise and join already planned events to fight for life below water. 
            Some event examples: Fishing limits in the Oslofjord to ensure sustainable growth of the aquatic species. Making sure the reefs are taken care of and not destroyed, which In return would boost the quality of aquatic life. 
        </p>
        
        <li tabindex="1">15. Life on land:</li>
        <p class="unGoal" tabindex="1">
            People could organise and join already planned events to fight for life on land.
            Ex: Preservation of bees. Stopping rainforest harvesting, Protest the big oil companies invading to destroy natural resources for oil. 
        </p>
        
        <li tabindex="1">17. Partnership for the goals:</li>
        <p class="unGoal" tabindex="1">
            Encourage teamwork and a sense of community by getting together and working for a common cause for the greater good.  
        </p>
        
        <br><br>
        <h2 tabindex="1">Other thoughts:</h2>
        <p tabindex="1">
            Our idea is that by creating a platform for enviromental activities, more people will start to care and take action. We live in a time where allmost everyone has a smart phone in their pocket, and has access to a vast array of tools. Our suggested plaform will count as an additional tool in that toolbox. If it works as intended, it will become very easy to arrange and take part in events that actually makes a difference for our planets well being.
