        <p tabindex="1">We decided to start ideating around such a platform. Our focus has been on making the platform simple to navigate and enjoyable to use. The enjoyment becomes implemented via two factors. [1]The ones allready invested in working towards a better, more sustainable future will have a platform for locating and creating events that supports their cause. We hope that such an app would make it easier for people to come together and make these changes more easily. [2]We also decided that some form of gamification would create incentives for people to stay active on our platform. </p>
        
        <h2 tabindex="1">Explaining the gamification aspect:</h2>
        <p tabindex="1">The gamification system we have planned for our app bases on dynamically changing your selected background screen based on how active you are as a user. We have three predefined background choices to start out with. A forest theme, ocean theme and animal theme. Each of these will start rather barren, but as you engage in activities, a seed may start to grow into a tree. Or a lonely fish will get more and more company. More animals will come, and before you know it, the background has evolved with sprawling life.</p>
