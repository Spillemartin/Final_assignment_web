            We decided to start ideating around a platform described on the problempage. Our focus has been on making the platform simple to navigate and enjoyable to use. The enjoyment becomes implemented via two factors. [1]The ones allready invested in working towards a better, more sustainable future will have a platform for locating and creating events that supports their cause. We hope that such an app would make it easier for people to come together and make these changes more easily. [2]We also decided that some form of gamification would create incentives for people to stay active on our platform.

            Our solution for said problem is to make a website/app based platform. This platform uses GPS data to track nearby Events other people have created and will track self made events as well. There will be options to categorise events based on location or field of impact. This way you can choose to go to climate events that directly affects the things you care about the most. Another function we plan to implement is a map/region function that lets you see events close to you or to your selected region.

            Adrian came up with the idea of maybe having a dynamic background that evolved based on event participation. This seemed like a great idea so Martin started sketching some evolutions. The users of our platform will be able to decide between three background presets. One for aquatic life, one for life on land and one for floral life. When the user has chosen a preset, they will have this as their background on the app. It starts small. In the aquatic version you see a lonely fish swimming around. In the life on land version, you might see a random animal by itself. And In the floral one you might see a treeseed barely sprouting. 
        <p tabindex="1">
            As you progress and participate in events, so does your theme. The fish will start to get accompanied by other species and the screen will become more alive. The lonely animal will get friends as well, and soon the screen will flourish with a diversity of life. The seed starts to grow, to branch out. And before you know it, a lush forest stand before you. 
        </p>
        <p tabindex="1">
            This will work as an incentive to participate in events near you. And the feedback, besides for doing something good for the environment of course, will be shown as a visual change in your app. You help the world, and at the same time grow your own little ecosystem.
