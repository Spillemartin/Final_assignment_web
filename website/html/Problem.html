        <p tabindex="1">
            At our first meeting we wrote down the 17 goals of UN and had a lengthy brainstorming session to look for problems involving these goals. This took around one hour. We had a look at all of the suggestions and categorised them so that we could see which of the 17 goals impacted the problem and eventual solution. We soon realised that many of the problems impacted more than one of the 17 goals. There was a quick voting session to decide a concrete problem to work along.

        <h3 tabindex="1">What is our defined problem?</h3>
        <p tabindex="1">
             The problem our group is facing is the difficulty of finding relevant nearby climate activities. There are some existing solutions but they only cover very specific activities. Like <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/" tabindex="1">Global climate strike</a>. This website displays global climate strikes, and thats about it. Nothing local whatsoever.
        </p>        
        <h3 tabindex="1">Why is the problem important?</h3>
        <p tabindex="1">
            In this day and age it is more important than ever spread awareness and partake in enviromental activities. Our planet is dying, and it is us, the inhabitants that has to take a stand and make changes. Both for ourselves and for future generations. We feel that the problem we are focusing on is an essential one to make the future brighter and motivate the masses to make the changes needed.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="1">   
            We desire a platform where you can be constantly notified of events happening near you. Not just marches and strikes, but events of awareness and sharing of information and knowledge. As there are no current platforms for doing this in a shared way, we decided that this is something we would prototype for our final project.
