            On of the problems our group is facing is the difficulty of finding relevant nearby climate activities. There are some existing solutions but they only cover very specific activities. Like <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/">Global climate strike</a>. This website displays global climate strikes, and thats about it. Nothing local whatsoever.

        <p>
            We desire a platform where you can be constantly notified of events happening near you. Not just marches and strikes, but events of awareness and sharing of information and knowledge. As there are no current platforms for doing this in a shared way, we decided that this is something we would prototype for our final project.
